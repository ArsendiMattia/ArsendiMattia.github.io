I will never forget the first time I came across Statistics: I was 19 years old, studying Physical Education and Sport Science. I discovered Statistics by chance since it was a topic of one course. This course wholly changed my viewpoint as I was compelled by the power and advantages that statistical models can give. Thus, I decided to change my city, university, and degree program, beginning this exciting journey into Statistics at the University of Padua.

During my years as a Bachelorâ€™s student, I had the chance to encounter the Bayesian reasoning. The idea of having a probabilistic formalization for updating our understanding of what surrounds us as more and more evidence becomes available amazed me. I wanted to master and make the Bayesian approach an integral element of my daily life.

There are a lot of answers that I do not have, even questions that I do not have. So, I am working on bonding my three passions: Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning, and sports analytics.
